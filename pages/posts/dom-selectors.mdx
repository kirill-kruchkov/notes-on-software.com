# A better practice for selecting DOM elements in tests

## TL;DR

The advice is to ditch `test-id`s and use accessibility attributes. But because
as of 2021, the Accessibility Object Model browser API is still in its infancy,
you will need to use the [Testing library](https://testing-library.com/) as a
polyfill.

## The problem

While it's possible to get by without defining an approach to selecting DOM
elements in unit tests where the DOM tree is small, for in-browser tests with
big DOM trees it's necessary to establish a way to relyably select DOM elemets
to programmatically interact with the application.

## The options

These are some of the options

- Using CSS classes. Not a good idea because visual changes might break the tests.
- Using `test-id`, `data-cy` (recommended in Cypress docs)


- philosophical question using an example with a single button (do you expect
another button to show up there?)
